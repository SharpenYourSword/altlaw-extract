Because of bugs in the JRuby Maven plugin, Hpricot has to be installed
manually.  Use the following command to install Hpricot:

mvn -fn jruby-rake:install-gems -Djruby.gems='--no-rdoc --no-ri hpricot --version ~>0.6.1'


This will display an error message if Hpricot is already installed,
which you can ignored.


This only needs to be done once, after which "mvn install" should be
sufficient to build the project.
